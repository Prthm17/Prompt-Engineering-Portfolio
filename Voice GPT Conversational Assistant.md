You: write a python code for chatgpt and whisper based voice assistant

ChatGPT:
Sure! Here's an example of Python code that combines ChatGPT and a Whisper-based voice assistant using the SpeechRecognition and pyttsx3 libraries:

python
Copy code
import speech_recognition as sr
import pyttsx3
import os
import openai

# Set up the ChatGPT API
openai.api_key = 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'

# Initialize the speech recognition engine
r = sr.Recognizer()

# Initialize the text-to-speech engine
engine = pyttsx3.init()

# Function to convert speech to text
def listen():
    with sr.Microphone() as source:
        print("Listening...")
        r.pause_threshold = 1
        audio = r.listen(source)
    try:
        print("Recognizing...")
        query = r.recognize_google(audio, language='en-US')
        print(f"User: {query}")
        return query
    except Exception as e:
        print("Please say that again...")
        return None

# Function to speak the assistant's response
def speak(text):
    engine.say(text)
    engine.runAndWait()

# Function to interact with the ChatGPT model
def chat_with_gpt(query):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine='text-davinci-003',
        prompt=query,
        max_tokens=50,
        temperature=0.7,
        top_p=1.0,
        frequency_penalty=0,
        presence_penalty=0
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Main loop
while True:
    # Listen for user input
    query = listen()

    if query:
        # Process user query using ChatGPT
        gpt_response = chat_with_gpt(query)

        # Print and speak the response
        print(f"ChatGPT: {gpt_response}")
        speak(gpt_response)
Please note that you'll need to install the required libraries by running the following command:

Copy code
pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 openai
Remember to replace 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY' with your actual OpenAI API key, which you can obtain from the OpenAI website.

This code sets up a voice assistant that listens to user input using the microphone, converts the speech to text, sends the text query to ChatGPT for processing, and then speaks the response generated by ChatGPT using the pyttsx3 library. The conversation continues in a loop until the user stops the program.

Feel free to customize and extend this code to suit your specific needs!
You: write a function to convert speech to text using whisper

ChatGPT:
To convert speech to text using the Whisper ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) system, you can use the DeepSpeech library, which is based on Whisper. Here's an example of a function that takes an audio file as input and returns the corresponding text:

python
Copy code
import deepspeech

# Function to convert speech to text using Whisper
def speech_to_text(audio_file):
    # Load the pre-trained Whisper model
    model_path = 'path/to/your/whisper/model.pbmm'
    model = deepspeech.Model(model_path)

    # Set the model parameters
    beam_width = 500
    lm_alpha = 0.75
    lm_beta = 1.85
    model.setBeamWidth(beam_width)
    model.enableExternalScorer(None)
    model.setScorerAlphaBeta(lm_alpha, lm_beta)

    # Read the audio file
    with open(audio_file, 'rb') as file:
        audio = file.read()

    # Perform speech-to-text transcription
    text = model.stt(audio)
    return text

# Example usage
audio_file = 'path/to/your/audio.wav'
transcript = speech_to_text(audio_file)
print(transcript)
In the above code, make sure to replace 'path/to/your/whisper/model.pbmm' with the actual path to your Whisper model file. You'll need to download and place the pre-trained Whisper model in the specified path.

Additionally, you'll need to install the DeepSpeech library by running the following command:

Copy code
pip install deepspeech
This code utilizes the deepspeech.Model class to load the Whisper model and set the desired parameters for speech recognition. Then, it reads the audio file using binary mode, performs the speech-to-text transcription using the model.stt() method, and returns the resulting text.

Feel free to adapt this function to your specific use case, such as incorporating it into the previous code snippet for a voice assistant.
You: write a function to convert speech to text using whisper api

ChatGPT:
To convert speech to text using the Whisper API, you can make HTTP POST requests to the API endpoint. Here's an example of a function that takes an audio file, sends it to the Whisper API, and returns the corresponding text:

python
Copy code
import requests

# Function to convert speech to text using the Whisper API
def speech_to_text(audio_file):
    # API endpoint
    endpoint = 'https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/whisper/transcriptions'

    # Read the audio file
    with open(audio_file, 'rb') as file:
        audio = file.read()

    # Set the headers and parameters
    headers = {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
        'Transfer-Encoding': 'chunked',
        'Accept': 'application/json',
    }
    params = {
        'model': 'whisper',
    }

    # Make the API request
    response = requests.post(endpoint, headers=headers, params=params, data=audio)

    # Parse the response and extract the transcript
    if response.status_code == 200:
        transcript = response.json()['transcriptions'][0]['text']
        return transcript
    else:
        print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")
        return None

# Example usage
audio_file = 'path/to/your/audio.wav'
transcript = speech_to_text(audio_file)
print(transcript)
In the above code, replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual Whisper API key, which you can obtain from the OpenAI website.

Make sure you have the requests library installed. If not, you can install it by running the following command:

Copy code
pip install requests
The function speech_to_text reads the audio file in binary mode and makes an HTTP POST request to the Whisper API endpoint. It includes the audio data, API key, and other required parameters in the request headers and query parameters. The response contains the transcript, which is extracted from the JSON response.

Feel free to integrate this function into your code or modify it as needed for your specific use case.
You: write a python code to connect whisper api to microphone

ChatGPT:
To connect the Whisper API to the microphone and perform real-time speech recognition, you can use the sounddevice library to capture audio from the microphone and the requests library to send the audio data to the Whisper API. Here's an example of Python code that accomplishes this:

python
Copy code
import sounddevice as sd
import requests

# Function to stream audio data to the Whisper API
def stream_audio_to_whisper(frames, sample_rate):
    # API endpoint
    endpoint = 'https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/whisper/transcriptions'

    # Set the headers and parameters
    headers = {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
        'Transfer-Encoding': 'chunked',
        'Accept': 'application/json',
    }
    params = {
        'model': 'whisper',
    }

    # Make the API request
    response = requests.post(endpoint, headers=headers, params=params, data=frames.tobytes())

    # Parse the response and extract the transcript
    if response.status_code == 200:
        transcript = response.json()['transcriptions'][0]['text']
        print("Transcript:", transcript)
    else:
        print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")

# Constants for audio recording
duration = 10  # Recording duration in seconds
sample_rate = 16000  # Sample rate in Hz

# Callback function to capture audio frames
def audio_callback(indata, frames, time, status):
    stream_audio_to_whisper(indata, sample_rate)

# Start audio recording
with sd.InputStream(callback=audio_callback, channels=1, samplerate=sample_rate):
    print("Listening...")
    sd.sleep(int(duration * 1000))
    print("Done")
Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual Whisper API key, which you can obtain from the OpenAI website.

Make sure you have the sounddevice and requests libraries installed. If not, you can install them by running the following command:

Copy code
pip install sounddevice requests
In this code, the stream_audio_to_whisper function takes the audio frames captured by the microphone and sends them as data in an HTTP POST request to the Whisper API endpoint. The response is parsed to extract the transcript.

The code then uses sounddevice.InputStream to open a stream from the microphone and starts capturing audio frames. The audio_callback function is called for each new batch of frames, and it calls stream_audio_to_whisper to send the audio data to the API.

The code will listen for audio input for a specified duration (in this case, 10 seconds). Adjust the duration variable as needed.

Feel free to customize and extend this code to suit your specific requirements!
